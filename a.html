       There are moments in life when you miss someone so much that you just want to pick them from your dreams and hug
    them for real! Dream what you want to dream;go where you want to go;be what you want to be,because you have only one
    life
       and one chance to do all the things you want to do.May you have enough happiness to make you sweet,enough trials to make you strong,enough sorrow to keep you
    human,enough hope to make you happy? Always put yourself in others’shoes.If you feel that it hurts you,it probably
    hurts the other person, too.The happiest of people don’t necessarily have the best of everything;they just make the most of everything that
    comes along their way.Happiness lies for those who cry,those who hurt, those who have searched,and those who have
    tried,for only they can appreciate the importance of people<br>

    　　who have touched their lives.Love begins with a smile,grows with a kiss and ends with a tear.The brightest future
    will always be based on a forgotten past, you can’t go on well in lifeuntil you let go of your past failures and
    heartaches.<br>
    　　When you were born,you were crying and everyone around you was smiling.Live your life so that when you die,you're
    the one who is smiling and everyone around you is crying.<br>
